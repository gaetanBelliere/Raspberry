# Raspberry
Personnal project using Raspberry Pi 4, kindly offered by Elliptika after I won a battleCode during my internship there.

## First Project is a Twitter bot

I followed this tutorial online : https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-build-a-raspberry-pi-twitter-bot/
And it looked and is very easy for a first Raspberry project. For now all it does is tweeting the sentence I'm giving him before executing the file : $ python TwitterBot.py "Hello World!". Or, if nothing is given, it juts tweets the title of a great song. 

## Second project is a retro gaming console

I followed this tutorial online : https://retropie.org.uk/docs/First-Installation/
After the installation step completed, all I had to do was to find ROMs to actually have games to play on my gaming console. This website gives the possibility to download some :

Download the games you want and remember to have fun !
